# Disaster Data of Indonesia

These data processed here are obtained from Indonesian Government ([BNPB](https://gis.bnpb.go.id/)).

These data were downloaded on 4/13/2021. Therefore, Shall I need to add more updated data, I need to retrieve the data manually starting from the date.

There are 12 disaster types presented in this data, as following:

{'cyclone', 'landslide', 'flood', 'earthquake',
       'high-tide/abrasion', 'forest and land fire', 'drought',
       'ground movement', 'volcanic eruption', 'volcanic activities',
       'tsunami', 'earthquake+tsunami'}
